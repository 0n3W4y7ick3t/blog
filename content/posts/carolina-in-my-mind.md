*[whistle]* \
*In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina* \
*Can't you see the sunshine* \
*Oh can't you just feel the moonshine* \
*And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind* \
*Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*Karin, she's a silver sun* \
*You'd best walk away and watch it shine* \
*Watch her watch the morning come* \
*A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I* \
*Said I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*There ain't no doubt in no one's mind* \
*That love's the finest thing around* \
*Whisper something soft and kind* \
*And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I* \
*Said I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina* \
*Can't you see the sunshine* \
*Oh can't you just feel the moonshine* \
*And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind* \
*Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*Dark and silent late last night* \
*I think I might have heard the highway calling* \
*Geese in flight and dogs that bite* \
*And signs that might be omens say I'm going,* \
*Yes I gotta be going* \
*I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*Now with a holy host of others' standing 'round me* \
*Still I'm on the dark side of the moon* \
*And it looks like it goes on like this forever* \
*You must forgive me* \
*If I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind* \
 \
*In my mind I'm gone to Carolina* \
*See the sunshine oh*
*Can't you just feel the moonshine yeah* \
*And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind* \
*Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind* \
*Said I'm gone to Carolina* \
*I'd better get myself on home again real soon*
