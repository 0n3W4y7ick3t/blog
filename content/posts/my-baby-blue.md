_Guess I got what I deserved_ \
_Kept you waiting there too long my love_ \
_All that time without a word_ \
_Didn’t know you’d think that I’d forget_ \
_Or I’d regret_ \
_The special love I had for you_ \
_My baby blue_ \
_All the days became so long_ \
_Did you really think I’d do you wrong_ \
_Dixie, when I let you go_ \
_Thought you’d realized that I would know_ \
_I would show_ \
_The special love I have for you_ \
_My baby blue_
